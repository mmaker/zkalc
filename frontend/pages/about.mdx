Cryptographers tend to be good at cryptography but they can be quite bad at
estimating the time it takes a computer to run their schemes.

<center>
_[zkalc](https://github.com/asn-d6/zkalc) helps you calculate how much time
cryptographic operations take on a real computer_
</center>

We hope that zkalc can help shorten the gap between cryptography and practice:

- Cryptographers can use the simple zkalc UX to learn how fast their paper will
  run on various machines
- Protocol designers can easily tune the parameters of their protocol depending on their requirements

We designed zkalc to be easy to use but also *easy to extend*. Writing new types of benchmarks, or adding fresh data to the zkalc website is easy. We hope that this way we can motivate you to improve zkalc to better fit your needs. See below for more details.

## zkalc tips

Here are some ways you can squeeze more juice out of zkalc:

- Hover over operations to get more details about them
- Hover over a machine or a library to get more details about the benchmark setup
- Click on the title to reset zkalc
- Click on the total time to get the result in SI units (seconds)
- Type over the dropdown select menu to autocomplete the cryptographic operation
- Type inside the quantity box any arithmetic operation, even common constants like `e` and `pi` or functions like `log2`

## Enriching zkalc

zkalc does not currently support all possible cryptographic operations. For
example, we do not currently have benchmarks for FFTs, or batch inversion formulae.

If a functionality you need is missing, please help us add it! First, make sure
you <Link href="/methodology">check out our methodology page</Link> and then
follow the instructions below:

- Find the existing benchmarks in the `backend/` directory, and add benchmark
  code for the new cryptographic operation following the
  [already existing conventions](https://github.com/asn-d6/zkalc/blob/main/backend/blstrs/benches/bench_blstrs.rs).
- Run all benchmarks on your machine by running `make` in the `backend/`
  directory.

Last but not least please open a PR with your changes and the json benchmark output files
and we will take care of the rest!

In the sections below, we provide more information on how to mod zkalc:

### Benchmarking on another machine

zkalc only supports a few machine types right now. Do you have access to a beefy
AWS machine or to some GPU prover? We would love to get in touch!

Simply run all benchmarks on your beefy AWS machine by running `make` in the
`backend/` directory. Then open a PR with the json benchmark output files and we
will take care of the rest!

If your machine is especially weak (rpi4) or particularly strong (GPU prover)
consider modifying the benchmark parameters (e.g. increase/decrease the size of
the MSMs) and get in touch with us!

### Testing new curves and libraries

zkalc supports only a limited number of curves (BLS12-381) and libraries (arkworks, blstrs).
We would love to support BLS12-377, curve25519 or whatever really.

To add benchmarks for a different elliptic curve, write benchmarks for the new
curve in the `backend/` directory following the
[already existing conventions](https://github.com/asn-d6/zkalc/blob/main/backend/blstrs/benches/bench_blstrs.rs).

Note that if your benchmarks do not use the
[criterion benchmark framework](https://docs.rs/criterion/latest/criterion/) you
will need to adapt your benchmark framework to output a JSON file that the zkalc
interpolation script understands (it currently
[understands a small subset](https://github.com/asn-d6/zkalc/blob/main/perf/fit.py#L128)
of the
[format](https://github.com/asn-d6/zkalc/blob/main/perf/blstrs/estimates.json)
of criterion's `estimates.json`). If you are confused, get in touch and we will
help.

Finally, please open a PR with your changes and the json benchmark output files
and we will take care of the rest!
